CS50G Breakout (Assignment #2)

Original code [by Colton Ogden](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/1/flappy/)

Assignment:

1. ~~Add a powerup to the game that spawns two extra Balls.~~
2. Grow and shrink the Paddle when the player gains enough points or loses a life.
3. Add a locked Brick that will only open when the player collects a second new powerup, a key, which should only spawn when such a Brick exists and randomly as per the Ball powerup.
